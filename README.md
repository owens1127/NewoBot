This is a private Discord (and a little bit for Twitch) Bot I have been working on sporadically over the last 3-4 years.

The bot can respond messages (prefixed with the . prefix), creates an XP leaderboard for each server it is in by granting XP for messages and time spent in voice channels. The bot is also set up in a few servers to create roles for each user based on their user ID, which allows users to select their own role color.

The bot is designed for private in use smaller servers of course.
